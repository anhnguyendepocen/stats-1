Put your code in the section below (and probably edit the title/author stuff above)

To compile this, save the file somewhere (without any spaces in the name) and then click "Knit PDF" above to make a pdf. If it doesn't work, you may need to run `install.packages("rmarkdown")` in R first.

Problem 1 can go here:
```{r}
# your code here
```

And Problem 4 can go here:
```{r}
# your code here
```

You can also change this text and answer other parts of this (or other) questions here if you like. (You can even us LaTeX commands if you want.)
